## Project Overview

This repository contains the materials related to my undergraduate thesis, which received a **maximum grade (10.0)** and was developed as part of the Computer Engineering program at **PUC-Rio**.

The project proposes and implements a new class of univariate **non-Gaussian Score-Driven (GAS)** models with **non-linear combinations of unobserved components**, such as trend and seasonality. It extends the framework implemented in the open-source Julia package [`UnobservedComponentsGAS`](https://github.com/LAMPSPUC/UnobservedComponentsGAS), developed by the LAMPS laboratory at PUC-Rio.

Key contributions include:
- Allowing **nonlinear interactions** among components (e.g., multiplicative trend-seasonality structures).
- Generalizing the model to **non-Gaussian conditional distributions** using the GAS updating mechanism.
- Estimating the models via **maximum likelihood** using robust optimization techniques.
- Applying the models to real-world time series and comparing their performance to traditional additive structures.
